This project is a part of my journey to get back into Data Science.

## Goal
The goal is to trick YouTube's algorithm into accepting automated views.
Different examples are going to be presented in this project, from AutoGUI to Selenium using Proxy rotation.

Please feel free to reach out for further developpement.

### Instructions
To check how the code works, please use the jyputer notebook. For running the script through cmd use the Generate_views.py.

### Limitations
Currently our proxies are not the best. We are struggling to find good proxies to iterate and the ones that we find are already used somewhere else or very slow.
This part needs improvement.

**Best regards.**
